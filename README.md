Questions for the play testers:

1. The maze scene is suppose to be intentionally dark. On a scale of 1-10, with one being too dark and 10 being too light, how does the maze look in the dark?
2. Continuing from question 1, how powerful does the flashlight feel on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being too weak and 10 being too bright?

Design Hypothesis: To see if the increase in lighting levels and adjusted flashlight create a better visual enviroment for the player.

Feedback analysis: Arena is still far too dark for most players. Will need to simplify room for final prototype and focus on lighting. During live playback, tester found an error when they transitioned to the secondary scene. Suspect this has something to do with screen dimensions and will look to rectify this by the end. Final maze design will be less maze and more room with low level lighting testing.
