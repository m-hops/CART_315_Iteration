Questions for the play testers:

1. The maze scene is suppose to be intentionally dark. On a scale of 1-10, with one being too dark and 10 being too light, how does the maze look in the dark?
2. Continuing from question 1, how powerful does the flashlight feel on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being too weak and 10 being too bright?
